# Contacts
This is a demo app I'm working on to learn about Node.js, Express.js, and CouchDB

The goal is to create a working "Contacts" app with create/view/edit/delete features, plus a few more as they come to mind. 

I'm using a Raspberry Pi to develop this on. I've included the install instructions I used to install all of the software I'm using to run this app.

Feel free to help with it.

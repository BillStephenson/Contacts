# Contacts
This is a demo app I'm working on to learn about Node.js, Express.js, and CouchDB

I'm working towards a simple "Contacts" app with create/view/edit/delete features, and possibly a few more as they come to mind. 

I'm also working development framework to be used on a Raspberry Pi. I've included the install instructions I used to install all of the software I'm using to run this app.

As I move forward on this I'll refine the install instructions for the Pi and add installing this app to them.
